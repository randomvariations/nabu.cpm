# CP/M 3.0 for the NABU Personal Computer using a simple compact flash adapter

This repository contains three files consisting of a modified rev29 ROM to identify the compact flash card and initialize it in 8-Bit mode, a hard drive image that can be written to the compact flash card, and a bare copy of cpm3.sys with updates to use LBA mode for the hard drive interface.
